# Just-Pick
Random restaurant generator. 

_You Pick_


Have you ever wanted to go out to eat but can't decide what you want for dinner?
Just Pick! 

Just Pick is an application developed to help you decide what restaurant to eat at. Every time you click the button, a random restaurant is generated for you in your local area. 

Enjoy! 

## Build Details

We created this project using CSS, HTMl, Javascript, and jQuery. 
Materialize was used to help with the stylization. 
The Zomato and Foodish API were used to select a random restaurant with images.
